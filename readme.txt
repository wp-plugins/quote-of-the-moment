A widgetized and themeable inspirational quote plugin.

== Description ==

[Quote Of The Moment](http://spoffle.com/plugins/quote-of-the-moment/) automatically shows random formatted inspirational quotes within your wordpress installation. By default the quotes are collected from spoffle.com's database, therefore it is not necessary to have your own database.

However, if you do not want to use the spoffle.com database on your site, please look at [this post](http://spoffle.com/coding/server-side-code-for-the-quote-of-the-moment-plugin/) which outlines all the code used for the server side delivery of quotes, allowing you to easily create your own.  You can then navigate to the admin options within your Wordpress dashboard for Quote Of The Moment and change the default source URL to your own.

= Features =

From within the admin options page you can set how often you want the quote to automatically change on your site by setting the poll interval: the default is 10 seconds (10000 ms).

There are 3 themeable div elements. The overall 'qotm_container', and the 'qotm_quote' and 'qotm_author' elements. See the included style.css file for more information.

Also, if you mouseover the quote it will stop refreshing until you mouseleave the area, allowing you to read the quote without risk of it changing.

== Installation ==
1. Download Quote Of The Month.
2. Unzip and upload the 'quote-of-the-month' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory, using your favorite method (ftp, sftp, scp, etc...)
3. Activate Quote Of The Month from your Plugins page.

= Once Activated =
1. Go to the Appearance > Widgets section of your Dashboard and drag the Quote Of The Month Widget to the desired area of your site.
